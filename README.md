# Welcome to Now-Weather-App!

I create this weather app while learning node js, it uses **Mapbox API** for geocoding location entered by user and **Darksky API** for fetching weather details of the location. It uses callback pattern in API development, the API itself is written using express framework. For templates **hbs** module is used which implements **Handlebars**. Application is deployed on **Heroku**.
